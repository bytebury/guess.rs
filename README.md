## About
I was tired of using planning poker tools that had limits,
ads, and made you pay for something pretty straightforward.

Therefore, guess was born out of that frustration. It's a
free tool for Agile teams that let you point stories anonymously
to invoke discussions and alleviate misunderstanding on teams.
